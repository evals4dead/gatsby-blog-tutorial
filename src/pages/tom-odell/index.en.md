Tomorrow! Tom Odell will perform a live concert in Seoul, Korea.

Actually, I started to listen Tom Odell's songs after I reservated his concert.
And I am a big fan of MUSE, I have used to listen a music with powerful energy, but Tom Odell's music is opposite from such music. His songs are little more restraining than MUSE's.
Anyway, I am listening his songs very often these days. So I am trying to understand his music. His music is charismatic without exploding emotions.

Without such a sexy gear, some kind of powerful vocal or tremendous solo performance, his performances are always dominate the listner's mind.
I think he has a good skill of composition. Not depending on many gears, he can make a beautiful songs. Without such splendid swag, his melody makes listeners' mind.

I tried to search some informations of his life, but I couldn't find many informations about him.
Tom Odell started to compose a song when he was 13 years old.
He went to musical college, and while he was college student, he had performed for street music contest.
He has won a prize from English critics.

# A Funny Video

In this video, he interview himself. I think it's funny to see that he is trying to syncronize himself and trying to keep his mind calm.

I wanna listen a lot of good musician's music like Tom Odell.
I will be really happy to see him in tomorrow's concert.

Bottom youtube links are my favourite songs by him.

My first song of him is Another Love. I thinkg Magnetised has really similar emotion with Another Love.

You must listen this song. If you wanna know him!
Very charismatic but not exploding his emotions.
I thinkg he is saying "I wanna tell something, but I don't use my unnecessary emotions!" in this music video.

Frankly, I didn't see this song's lyrics. But I wanna visit Jubilee Road while I am listening this song.
Very forky music.
